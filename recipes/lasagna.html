        "[This is] actually quite easy to make for someone who has never made lasagna before," <br>

        Everyone loved it, and I will definitely make it again."

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
        <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; <br>
            cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, <br>
            about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, <br>
            basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, <br>
            stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.<br>
            Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, <br>
            8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
