        <h2 class="recipe-desc">This pasta sauce is excellent in lasagna or as a meat sauce. I use it in my popular<br>
            lasagna recipe, so I thought I'd share it on its own.</h2>

            Awesome recipe. I made this last night for Valentines dinner and we couldn't stop eating<br>
            it! I used 2 fresh habaneros which I roasted @ 400*F for 10 minutes.Then threw shallots, garlic,<br> 
            and habaneros in food processor b-4 browning. I also added fresh chopped spinach to the pasta right <br>
            after I drained it and heated some left over chicken breast. Warning Very Addicting!

            I really enjoyed this recipe but agree with other reviews that it was a little bland, even <br>
            with extra shallots and garlic. We love it spicy so I used 2 peppers with seeds. Also, <br>
            I only used 1 tbsp of flour and it was perfect thickness. Will definitely make this again!
